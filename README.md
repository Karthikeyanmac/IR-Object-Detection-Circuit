# IR-Object-Detection-Circuit
I created a simple IR object detection circuit using an IR LED, photodiode, and LM358 as a comparator.  When an object comes near, the IR light reflects onto the photodiode, which changes its voltage. The LM358 compares this with a reference set by a potentiometer, and when the threshold is reached, the indicator LED turns ON.
